  Particle effect: The particle effect is "dust" trailing behind the player and is triggered whenever the player moves. <br />
  Tutorials: character 1, character 2, camera and ending game <br />
 Kevin: 
  Linear Interpolation: Linear Interpolation is used so that as the player moves towards the exit, the directional light will change color from blue to red.  <br />
  Tutorials: Environment, audio <br />
 Lukas: 
  Dot Product: Dot Product is used so that the ghosts will always be facing the player. This makes the game harder and unfortunately the game can no longer be completed past the second ghost. <br />
