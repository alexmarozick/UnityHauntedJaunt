  Particle effect: The particle effect is "dust" trailing behind the player and is triggered whenever the player moves. <br />
  Tutorials: character 1, character 2, camera and ending game <br />

  Linear Interpolation: Linear Interpolation is used such that as the player moves towards the light, the light intensity will change. It is a subtle difference. <br />

  Dot Product: Dot Product is used so that the ghosts will always be facing the player. This makes the game harder and unfortunately the game can no longer be completed past the second ghost. <br />
